            <P>I value resourcefulness, inteligence and integrity above all else in myself and others. I have no desire to work with people that are dishonest, lazy or not team players. The most important lesson I've learned in my professional life is that attitude is the most important aspect for an individual and a company. A company is only ever as good as the poeple running it no matter how good the product is.</P>
            <p>In my free time I like to ride my bike and go out in central Lawrence with friends. I am also an avid boardgame and videogame player. My favorite game is a tabletop called Warhammer 40K</p>
