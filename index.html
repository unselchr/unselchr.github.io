            <P>I value resourcefulness, inteligence and integrity above all else in myself and others. I work best in or leading a well structured team and I take a lot of pride in my ability to help friends and coworkers when they are stuck. In this line of work an extra set of eyse always helps! The most important lesson I've learned in my professional life is that attitude is the most important aspect for an individual and a company. A company is only ever as good as the poeple running it no matter how good the product is.</P>
            <p>In my free time I like to ride my bike and go out in central Lawrence with friends. I am also an avid boardgame and videogame player. My favorite game is a tabletop called Warhammer 40K</p>
